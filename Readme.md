## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your machine.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/dev-harshvats/Real-Time-Chat.git](https://github.com/dev-harshvats/Real-Time-Chat.git)
    cd Real-Time-Chat
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```sh
    cd Backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application Locally

You will need two separate terminal windows to run both the frontend and backend servers.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - In your first terminal, navigate to the `Backend` directory.
    - Run the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your backend WebSocket server should now be running on `ws://localhost:8080`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    - In your second terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    - Run the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running! Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your terminal).
